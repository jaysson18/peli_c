### Story

You are an adventurous traveler, who has always wanted to explore the world. One day, you decide you are going to take on the ultimate challenge and try to find the elusive and mysterious diamond of the sky.

You set off on your journey, traveling to the first airport on your list. When you arrived, you were greeted with a message on the airport's display board that said "Welcome to X Airport! You have X$ and Xkm of range left." 

You are determined to find the diamond, and you know you need money and range to do so. You decide to try your luck and open a lootbox at the airport. Much to your surprise, you win a great reward- money! You are ecstatic and now have the funds to continue on your journey.

With your newfound wealth, you are able to continue on your journey, but you have to be careful with your money and range. You are able to purchase fuel at each airport, and you eventually make it to the airport where the diamond is rumored to be.

Much to your surprise, when you arrive, you see the diamond shining in the sunlight. You have finally found the diamond!

You are elated, but you know you have to be careful as you make your way back to the starting airport. You have heard rumors that robbers are prowling around the airports, hoping to steal money and valuable items. As you make your way back, you are careful to not fall victim to any of their schemes.

When you finally arrive back at the starting airport, you are relieved to find that you still have the diamond and all the money you won along the way. You have won the challenge!

You are overjoyed with your success and the money you have won. You have finally found the diamond of the sky and were able to keep all of your hard-earned money.

### Database

This game uses the airport table from the database course.

1. Create a new database 'demogame': `CREATE DATABASE demogame;`
2. Switch to that database: `USE demogame;`
3. Import the same `lp.sql` as you did earlier in the database course: `source path/to/lp.sql`
4. Keep `airport` and `contry` tables, remove others: 
   - `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;`
   - `DROP TABLE game;`
   - `DROP TABLE goal;`
   - `DROP TABLE goal_reached;`
   - `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;`
5. Create the following tables:
   ```sql
     create table game
     (
         id           int auto_increment
             primary key,
         money        int(8)      null,
         location     varchar(10) null,
         screen_name  varchar(40) null,
         player_range int         null
     )
      charset = latin1;
   
   ```
   ```sql
    create table goal
    (
        id          int         not null
            primary key,
        name        varchar(40) null,
        money       int         null,
        probability int         null
    )
        charset = latin1;
    
    insert into goal (id, name, money, probability)
    values  (1, 'TOPAZ', 300, 4),
            (2, 'EMERALD', 600, 3),
            (3, 'RUBY', 1000, 2),
            (4, 'DIAMOND', 0, 1),
            (5, 'BANDIT', -1, 3);
   ```
   ```sql
    create table ports
    (
        id      int auto_increment
            primary key,
        game    int                  null,
        airport varchar(11)          not null,
        goal    int                  null,
        opened  tinyint(1) default 0 null
    );
   ```
6. Check that you have the necessary tables: `SHOW TABLES;`
   - The result should be like this:
   ```text
    +----------------+
    | Tables_in_test |
    +----------------+
    | airport        |
    | country        |
    | game           |
    | goal           |
    | ports          |
    +----------------+
   ```
