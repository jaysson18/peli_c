Ohjelmistopeli

GOAL:
find the evil villain who stole the climate stabilizer and turn it back on

SPECS:

-hero starts at random airport from 30 airports in europe, can move freely

-hero has unlimited range and fuel
-villain starts at random airport and can move to any one of the airports on the list

-flights are free because world government sponsors the hero/player

-every 100km will raise climate temp by 0.05C and when climate is +6C world explodes and hero dies (villain flights dont count to this)

HINT:

-every round we get a hint where the villain was last seen in form of a compass point ( for example villain moved last south-west from you)
